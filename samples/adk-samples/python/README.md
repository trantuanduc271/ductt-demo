This collection provides ready-to-use sample agents built on top of Python
[Agent Development Kit](https://github.com/google/adk-python). These agents
cover a range of common use cases and complexities, from simple conversational
bots to complex multi-agent workflows.

## 🚀 Getting Started with Python Samples

Follow these steps to set up and run the sample agents:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Install Python ADK:** Ensure you have Python Agent
        Development Kit installed and configured. Follow the Python instructions in the
        [ADK Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/#python).
    *   **Set Up Environment Variables:** Each agent example relies on a `.env`
        file for configuration (like API keys, Google Cloud project IDs, and
        location). This keeps secrets out of the code.
        *   You will need to create a `.env` file in each agent's directory you
            wish to run (usually by copying the provided `.env.example`).
        *   Setting up these variables, especially obtaining Google Cloud
            credentials, requires careful steps. Refer to the **Environment
            Setup** section in the [ADK Installation
            Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/#python)
            for detailed instructions.
    *   **Google Cloud Project (Recommended):** While some agents might run
        locally with just an API key, most leverage Google Cloud services like
        Vertex AI and BigQuery. A configured Google Cloud project is highly
        recommended. See the
        [ADK Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/#python)
        for setup details.


2.  **Clone this repository:**

    To start working with the ADK Python samples, first clone the public `adk-samples` repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
    cd adk-samples/python
    ```

3.  **Explore the Agents:**

    *   Navigate to the `agents/` directory.
    *   The `agents/README.md` provides an overview and categorization of the available agents.
    *   Browse the subdirectories. Each contains a specific sample agent with its own
    `README.md`.

4.  **Run an Agent:**
    *   Choose an agent from the `agents/` directory.
    *   Navigate into that agent's specific directory (e.g., `cd agents/llm-auditor`).
    *   Follow the instructions in *that agent's* `README.md` file for specific
        setup (like installing dependencies via `poetry install`) and running
        the agent.
    *   Browse the folders in this repository. Each agent and tool have its own
        `README.md` file with detailed instructions.

**Notes:**

These agents have been built and tested using
[Google models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models)
on Vertex AI. You can test these samples with other models as well. Please refer
to [ADK Tutorials](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tutorials/) to use
other models for these samples.

## Local Contributor Pre-Check

Before submitting a Pull Request with changes to Python files, please run the following script locally to quickly validate your changes against our standards.

1.  Ensure you have **Python** installed and the script is executable (`chmod +x python-checks.sh`).
2.  Run the script from the repository root using a **run flag**, specifying the **relative path** to the agent or notebook folder you modified.

| Purpose | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Run all checks** (Black, iSort, Flake8) | `./python-checks.sh --run-all agents/agent_directory_name` |
| **Run only `flake8`** (Linting) | `./python-checks.sh --run-lint agents/agent_directory_name` |
| **Run only `black`** (Formatting) | `./python-checks.sh --run-black notebooks/notebook_directory_name` |
| **Run only `isort`** (Import Sorting) | `./python-checks.sh --run-isort notebooks/notebook_directory_name` |
| **Get detailed usage and options** | `./python-checks.sh --help` |

> **Note:** The script requires the full relative path starting with `agents/` or `notebooks/` (e.g., `agents/academic-research`). This ensures checks are scoped strictly to the component you are working on.

## 📝 Code Quality Checks

We use automated checks to ensure high quality and consistency across all code samples.

This script will run `black`, `isort` and `flake8` to check for formatting and linting errors.
